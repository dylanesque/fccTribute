    <p id="tribute-info">Darwyn Cooke was a Canadian graphic artist,
      primarily known for both his animated and comic-book work on
      DC Universe characters. Cooke spent much of his early career
      doing more traditional commercial graphic design work before
      being hired as a storyboard artist for Warner Bros Animation
      in the late 1990s. After working there for several years
      various shows, he started doing freelance comic book work. It
      during this time that the world at large was introduced to
      Cooke's distinctive style. Influenced in equal parts by film
      noir, the Space Age aesthetic of the 1950's and 1960's, and
      classic comic book illustrators like Jack Kirby and Alex Toth,
      Cooke's style stood in sharp contrast to his peers. Cooke's
      retro work is best seen in <em>DC: The New Frontier</em> and
      <em>Catwoman: Selina's Big Score</em>, his adaptations of
      Richard Stark's <em>Parker</em> novels for Dark Horse Comics,
      and too many individual covers and interior works to list here.
      Cooke unfortunately died suddenly in May of 2016, shortly after
      it was announced that he was battling an aggressive form of cancer.
      While it is tragic that Cooke died at the young age of 53, he left
      the world an embarrassment of riches in the form of his work.</p>
